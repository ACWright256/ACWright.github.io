# Overview
<n></n>
Our team created an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) for our experimental engineering course. The AUV was designed to conduct an experiment to determine the efficacy of our sonar system. This experiment involved deploying the robot and collecting depth data, GPS data, and raw sonar data at different locations at Dana Point. Using the depth data and sonar data, we were able to confirm that our sonar readings matched the expected depth of the harbor. 


# Deployments
In total, there were three deployments. At each deployment, the robot took multiple GPS, sonar, and pressure data records at the surface and 0.7 meters below the surface.
