# Overview
<n></n>
Our team created an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) for our experimental engineering course. The AUV was designed to conduct an experiment to determine the efficacy of our sonar system. This experiment involved deploying the robot and collecting depth data, GPS data, and raw sonar data at different locations at Dana Point. Using the depth data and sonar data, we were able to confirm that our sonar readings matched the expected depth of the harbor.


Sonar is an effective tool to map underwater objects such as the ocean floor. Sonar integration with an autonomous underwater robot provides an opportunity to collect data at more locations with no user input. An integrated sonar system can measure distances to objects by determining the delay between reflection and transmission of an acoustic signal. The goal of this project was to design and evaluate a simple sonar-based system to measure the depth of the Dana Point Harbor.

An autonomous underwater robot was designed to conduct an experiment to determine the efficacy of the sonar system. This was accomplished by comparing the sonarâ€™s recorded ocean depth at varying robot positions and depths. The robot was equipped with an audio exciter, a microphone, a pressure sensor, and a GPS. The sonar data were analyzed with a matched filter and inner product filter to measure the time of flight of the signals.
