### Ham Radio
In my free time, I am a ham radio operator. I currently have a general license, with hopes of upgrading to an Amateur Extra license within the next year. My call sign is KN6ZUN.

## Creating My Station

Over the summer of 2023, I (with help) setup an HF station. 
We initially set up a 10 meter ground plane antenna. Given typical ionospheric conditions in the area, we decided to create a 20 meter dipole antenna to improve the reach of the station.

Designing The Antenna
<n></n>
We wanted the antenna to be tuned to the center frequency (14.175 Mhz) of the 20 meter ham band. We chose to create a dipole antenna due to the simplicity of the design, ease of impedance matching, and decent gain. 
We determined the length of each leg to be about 16 feet and 6.1 inches. We used 12 AWG wire for each leg.

We created the feed point by drilling 4 holes into a PCV T connector, feeding the wires through the holes, and soldering the wires to a PL-259 connector. The antenna was then attached to rope, and strung between a tree and a barn. The coaxial cable was fed from the radio tuner to the feed point.

# Antenna Verification

We determined that our antenna's center frequency closely matched the desired 14.175 Mhz, and had a standing wave ratio of about 1.022.
