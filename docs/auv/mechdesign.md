The robot was designed to be compact and hydrodynamic, with a PVC frame equipped with four motors for depth and XY navigation. The center of mass was below the center of buoyancy, and the frame had an open top for easy access to electronics and less GPS interference. A vertically extruding PVC pipe supported the microphone and pressure tube at a standard depth, while the audio exciter was attached to the bottom of the mesh. The robot was made neutrally buoyant by adding pool noodles at the top.
