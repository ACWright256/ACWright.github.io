The mechanical design of the robot was dedicated towards a compact and hydrodynamic frame that maximized the functionality of each transducer underwater. The robot was also designed to hold more mass at its base, ensuring that the center of mass was below the center of buoyancy. A PVC frame was equipped with four motors, two in the vertical direction for depth control and two in the forward direction for XY navigation. An open top for the waterproof box allowed easy access to electronics inside and less interference when the GPS connected to satellites. A vertically extruding PVC pipe at the bottom of the robot supported the microphone and pressure tube at the same vertical position relative to the robot to standardize depth. The microphone was also sheltered from water currents inside the extruding pipe. The audio exciter was attached to the bottom of the mesh, also at a similar height as the microphone to standardize the sonar signal path length. Finally, pool noodles were added at the top to raise the center of buoyancy and make the robot neutrally buoyant.
